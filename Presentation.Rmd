##Title:


##What Are Elo Ratings
Elo ratings are used by FiveThirtyEight to predict the outcome of head-to-head matchups between NFL teams. They were originally developed for prediction of chess matches but have been extended to sports analytics.

+ Very little information needed to calculate 
+ Teams with higher Elo Ratings should beat teams with lower Elo Ratings

##The Data
```{r plot_elo, include = FALSE}

```


##Repeated Measures
Data contain 15 seasons with 16 games (observations) per season for each of the 32 NFL teams. I treat each season/team combination as independent. 

```{r plot_szn, include = FALSE}

```


##GAM-Smoothed Estimates

I used GAMS to estimate smooth versions of these noisy trends in Elo. Some teams started out with low expectations and exceeded them; some (like my Broncos) did the opposite. 

##Functional Data Clustering

##Some Conclusions
By clustering GAM-smoothed Elo curves, we get several groups that most teams fit into. We can call these teams:

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}


ggplot(df.reps) + geom_line(aes(game,car02),col = "red",size =2) + geom_line(aes(game,atl02),col = "orange",size = 2) + geom_line(aes(game,ari02),col = "green",size =2) + 
  geom_line(aes(game,gb02),col = "blue2", size = 2) + ggtitle("Representative Teams") + 
  theme_economist_white() + ylab("Elo Rating") + scale_x_continuous("Game",breaks = 1:16)
